                <p class="about">
                    A painter from Indulkana in South Australia, Vincent Namatjira has established
                    himself as a subversive and witty portraitist. Vincent is the great-grandson of
                    the renowned Arrernte watercolour artist Albert Namatjira. Vincent was born in
                    Alice Springs and spent his early childhood at Hermannsburg. When his mother
                    passed away unexpectedly, Vincent was removed from his family and raised in
                    foster homes. Intensely aware of his family’s history, he yearned to return to
                    the central desert. He moved back to Hermannsburg as a young adult and then
                    settled with his wife’s family at Kanpi, on the APY Lands, where he learnt to
                    paint in a customary dot painting style. Since 2013, Vincent has been painting
                    portraits of important figures, both personally familiar and famously political.
                    He is an acute observer of national and international politics and the
                    connections between leadership, wealth, power and influence.
